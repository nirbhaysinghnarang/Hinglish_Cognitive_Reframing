situation,thought
I finished second in the writing contest,"Being second means nothing, anyone could have achieved that"
I gained weight,I want to take revenge
I got bad grades in the exam,My teacher is the reason I'm not doing well
I had a fight with my husband,"My best friend doesn't fight with my husband this much, so I must be doing something wrong"
I missed the submission deadline,My efforts are wasted
